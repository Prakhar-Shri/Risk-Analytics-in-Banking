# Risk Analytics in Banking
This project aims to develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and how data can be used to minimize the loss of money while lending.

The dataset contains two types of scenarios -
- Customers who would be able to repay the loan but get denied by the bank; this would lead to loss of business
- Customers who would be unable to repay the loan but are given the loan; this would lead to capital loss
Here, both scenarios are harmful for the finance company. Hence, with this data, we will try to find insights on the customer demographic and what type of customers are able to repay the loan on time and which ones are not.

This analysis will help the bank take better and intelligent decisions for their business.
